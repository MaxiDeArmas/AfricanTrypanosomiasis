                    <h2>What causes African Trypanosomiasis?</h2>

                    <p><em>Trypanosoma brucei</em> is a protozoan parasite that is responsible for African trypanosomiasis. This
                        parasite has a complex lifecycle that includes the mammalian host and the tsetse fly vector
                        (Maxfield and Bermudez, 2023). The parasite <em>T. brucei</em> is divided into two subspecies: <em>T. b.
                        gambiense</em> and <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em>. These subspecies cause different types of disease that vary in
                        epidemiological patterns and clinical manifestations (Hopkins Medicine, 2024). <em>T. brucei</em>
                        primarily infects humans, as well as a variety of domestic and wild animals, including cattle,
                        pigs, and other mammals (CDC, 2024). Within mammals, <em>T. brucei</em> can live within host cells,
                        particularly in the bloodstream and the central nervous system, causing systemic and
                        neurological symptoms (CDC, 2024).</p>

                    <p>
                        The type of transmission of this disease is indirect-vector-borne since humans get infected
                        through the bite of infected tsetse flies (WHO, 2024). These flies can be commonly found in
                        rural areas, and they bite during the day, which also increases the possibility of the risk of
                        transmission to individuals living or working in the regions affected by this disease (CDC,
                        2023). Consequently, African trypanosomiasis is not directly contagious between humans.
