                    <h2>How can African Trypanosomiasis be treated?</h2>

                    <p>
                        There are two types of manifestation stages in human Africa trypanosomiasis: First, an early
                        hemolymphatic stage that then will convert into a meningoencephalitis stage (Cleveland Clinic,
                        2024). The initial symptoms we can see with this disease are or can include fever, headache,
                        joint
                        pain, and itching. Symptoms can progress to neurological complications such as sleep
                        disturbances,
                        confusion, and coma in the later stage (CDC, 2023).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To be diagnosed, several ways rely on clinical presentation such as blood or cerebrospinal fluid
                        examination using microscopies, apart from serological tests (WHO, 2024). Depending on the stage
                        and
                        subspecies of the parasite you have, different treatment options include medications such as
                        pentamidine, suramin, melarsoprol, and eflornithine (Hopkins Medicine, 2024). Human African
                        trypanosomiasis is usually lethal if left untreated (WHO, 2024). If a person recovers from
                        African
                        trypanosomiasis, there can be long-term effects, including potential permanent neurological
                        damage
                        (CDC, 2024).
                        Lack of resources and facilities for healthcare in the places afflicted by African
                        trypanosomiasis
                        suggests serious social and economic issues (CDC, 2023). This disease does not affect only
                        individual health but also agricultural productivity and obstructs socioeconomic development
                        (WHO,
                        2024).

                        There are several controls to decrease disease transmission and morbidity: vector management
                        such as
                        insecticide spraying, use of bed nets, and environmental modification to reduce tsetse fly
                        breeding
                        sites (Maxfield and Bermudez, 2023). Additionally, case detection and treatment strategies are
                        essential components of control efforts (Maxfield and Bermudez, 2023). However, challenges such
                        as
                        drug resistance, limited surveillance, and economic barriers make it difficult to apply
                        effective
                        control and eradication initiatives (Cleveland Clinic, 2024).
