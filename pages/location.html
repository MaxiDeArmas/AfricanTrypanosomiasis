                    <p>
                        The persistence of African trypanosomiasis in sub-Saharan Africa remains a significant challenge
                        for public health, impacting various societal, economic, and healthcare dimensions. Efforts to
                        combat the disease are ongoing, with initiatives focusing on research, surveillance, and
                        healthcare infrastructure investment. However, achieving control and elimination goals
                        necessitates sustained commitment and resources (WHO, 2024). Furthermore, while African
                        trypanosomiasis predominantly affects sub-Saharan Africa, isolated cases have been reported in
                        regions outside this area, emphasizing the importance of global vigilance (WHO, 2024).

                    <p>
                        Historical records indicate the first recorded case of African trypanosomiasis dates to the 14th
                        century (Hopkins Medicine, 2024). Epidemics and outbreaks of the disease have occurred
                        sporadically throughout history, contributing to significant morbidity and mortality in affected
                        regions (CDC, 2024). Historical treatments for African trypanosomiasis include the use of
                        various medications such as pentamidine, suramin, melarsoprol, and eflornithine (Hopkins
                        Medicine, 2024).

                    <p>
                        Each year, it is estimated that around 10,000 to 30,000 people are infected
                        with African trypanosomiasis, and without proper treatment, the disease can be fatal, resulting
                        in approximately 10,000 deaths annually (WHO, 2024). Therefore, improving vector management
                        strategies, such as insecticide spraying and environmental modifications, is crucial for
                        controlling the spread of the disease and reducing its burden (Maxfield and Bermudez, 2023).
